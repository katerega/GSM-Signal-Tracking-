================== Signal Tracker ===============
== Released 7 May 2011 by Henry Corrigan-Gibbs ==
=================================================
This project is based on Open GPS Tracker:
http://code.google.com/p/open-gpstracker/
and is released under the GNU GPLv3

== Requirements ==
- Android phone (tested with 2.1)
- Python (tested with 2.6)
- Imagemagick if you want to generate icons
	(tested with 6.5.8)
- KML file viewing tool (like Google Earth)

== How to use it ==
0) If you want to compile the APK file
yourself, do that. Otherwise, download
the pre-made .apk from www.henrycg.com/signal.

1) Copy the APK file OpenGPSTracker.apk
to your phone and install the app. You
might have to go into your "Application"
settings and enable "Developer Mode" and
the setting that allows you to install
unsigned applications.

2) Use the tracker software to record a
location path. This should work even if
the phone display is off but I have had the app
crash when I try to turn the screen off.

If you run in "fine" tracking mode, you will get
lots and lots of data points -- probably more
than you need.

3) Export the track as a GPX file (KML
doesn't work) and transfer it to your
computer.

4) If you don't already have 32 PNG files named
icon_[0-31].png then run the icon generation
script (requires imagemagick's "convert" tool):

	$ . generate_swatches.bash

This script generates 32 images -- one for every
GSM signal strength -- so that the signal strengths
can be displayed in color on the map. There may be
a better way to do this with KML, but this method
works quite well. You can tweak the parameters to
change the size and shape of the icons.

5) Use the python converter script to convert
the GPX file into a KML file for displaying
the route:

	$ python gpx2kml.py < Track-2011-03-24.gpx > out.kml

6) Fire up Google Earth and open your KML file.
